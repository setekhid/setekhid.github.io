Today there was one thing noticed by me, that I wrote a tech blog on our company web site. And this blog is in Chinese.

今天有件事情影响到我，我写了篇技术博客发到了公司网站上。这篇博客是用中文写成的。

It wasn't a big thing when I just started writing it, but it realy shocked me, when I've published it. It's in Chinese and I've swear to Devil I'd never ever written any Chinese blogs or articles, LOL.

本来没什么，但是写完发布时感觉怪怪的。这篇博客是用中文写的，可是我曾发誓永远不再写任何中文博客或者文章，哈哈。

At the autumn of 2013, I was trying to translate a book into Chinese, it's about Scala you may hear. Considering Scala is a functional language and can be used for real world developing rather than Haskell, I've decided to translate a book about it for Chinese developers. But no publisher like it, cause no one heard about functional. And none of my Chinese friends realized Scala is a big deal. "We've already got Java and SSHA" as they said.

2013年秋，我正打算翻译一本书，是关于scala语言的。当时考虑到Scala是一门函数式语言，并且是为数不多可以用于生产环境开发的语言。我打算为中国开发社区翻译一本入门书籍。不过没有出版社感兴趣，因为函数式那会中低端圈子几乎没人听说过。并且中国网友认为函数式语言纯粹玩具，业务开发Java已经活得很滋润了。

After lots of "Why why why", and lots of mocking, I've given up Chinese.

好些中低端程序员会反复地问“有啥意义？”，还有些人有些戏虐心态，最终我决定不再写中文。

But Here I am, and the first article on this blog is in Chinese. You may say something, but I'd say whatever, it's almost four years, I can forget.

距今已近四年。
